# Vortex Engine - README

## Overview

Welcome to the **Vortex Engine**, a custom-built framework designed in Unity for high-speed platforming and flashy combat. This engine draws inspiration from games like *Sonic Unleashed*, *Sonic Frontiers*, and *Zenless Zone Zero* and serves as the foundation for the fangame *Sonic X Shadow: Rise of The Beasts*.

The Vortex Engine is specifically tailored to create a dynamic and fluid gameplay experience, combining the thrill of speed with the depth of combat mechanics. While this framework is not intended for public distribution, it is designed to be modular, allowing for easy customization and expansion as the project evolves.

## Key Features

### 1. **High-Speed Platforming**
- **Momentum-Based Movement**: Players can feel the acceleration and deceleration based on terrain and player inputs, similar to classic Sonic gameplay.
- **Boost Mechanics**: Engage in exhilarating bursts of speed with the boost mechanic, designed to mimic the fast-paced action of *Sonic Unleashed*.
- **Parkour and Stunt System**: Perform wall runs, flips, and other acrobatic maneuvers seamlessly integrated with the speed mechanics.
- **Advanced Terrain Interaction**: Dynamic transitions between different terrains (grassy fields, cityscapes, loops, etc.) that maintain the speed and flow of the gameplay.

### 2. **Flashy Combat**
- **Combo System**: Engage in fast, combo-based combat inspired by *Zenless Zone Zero*, allowing for seamless transitions between attacks.
- **Character Abilities**: Unique abilities for Sonic and Shadow that reflect their personalities and powers (e.g., Chaos Control, Spin Dash attacks).
- **Target Lock-On**: A robust targeting system that ensures precise and responsive combat even at high speeds.
- **Skill Trees and Power-Ups**: Unlock new combat moves, enhance abilities, and gain power-ups that are woven into the narrative and progression of the game.

### 3. **Camera and Controls**
- **Dynamic Camera System**: A responsive camera that adjusts to the action, providing cinematic angles during high-speed sections and combat encounters.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Designed for fluidity, allowing players to transition smoothly between platforming and combat without losing momentum.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Fully customizable input settings to cater to different playstyles and control preferences.

### 4. **Physics and Interactions**
- **Realistic Physics Simulation**: A physics engine that balances the exaggerated speed and agility of Sonic and Shadow with the need for believable environmental interaction.
- **Environmental Hazards**: Various hazards that react dynamically to the playerâ€™s speed and combat actions, offering a balanced challenge.

### 5. **Modularity and Extensibility**
- **Modular Components**: The framework is built with modularity in mind, making it easy to add new mechanics, levels, and characters.
- **Expandable Content**: Designed to support the addition of new stages, enemies, and mechanics as the game development progresses.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
